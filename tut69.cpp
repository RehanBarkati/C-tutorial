/*
  STL- standard template library(library of generic classes and finction)
  why use STL?
--> STL is used because its a good idea not to reinvent the wheel.
 1. Reuse: well tested components
 2. time saving

--> Components of STL :
 1.Containers -store data,(use template classes) 
 2.Algorithms- sorting,searching,merging,(use template function)
 3.Iterators - object points to an element in a container, handled just like pointer,connect algorith with container.
