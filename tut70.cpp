/* --> Containers in STL
   Types of container :
   1. Sequence container- Linear fashion   e.g vector,list,dequeue 
   2.Associative container- Direct access   e.g map,set,multimap,multiset
   3.Derived container- real worlld modelling   e.g stack(first in last out),queue(first in first out) ,priority queue

   When to use which ?

   - Sequence container :
   1. vector - random access fast,insertion/deletion slow in middle ,insertion at the end is fast
   2. list - random access slow,middle insertion/deletion is fast,insertion/deletion at end is fast

   -associative container
   all operation are fast except random access because it store in tree like fashion

   - derived container
   depends
